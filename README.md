# AHK_hotkey_for_keyboard
need to have volume and brightness adjustment tool for key board

big thanks to all the help from AHK forum

for F1~F5 same as my asus keyboard

# how to use
download AHK from website and run the file directly(suggested in admin mode)

i also run it when computer turn on.

## exact order

shift+F1: mute

shift+F1: vol-10

shift+F1: vol+10

shift+F1: bright-10

shift+F1: bright+10

## future work
add some animation for ease to understand current volume and brightness
